# AWS IDENTITY CENTER & PERMISSION SETS

This task involved configuring **AWS Identity Center** to manage user access within my AWS account. As part of the requirement, I created a new user and assigned the **SecurityAudit** job function policy using a permission set.

The goal was to understand how to use AWS Identity Center to apply fine-grained access control for users, following best practices around identity and permissions.


## WHAT I DID

- I enabled AWS Identity Center in the AWS Console.
- I created a new user with login credentials.
- I created and assigned a permission set using the predefined **SecurityAudit** policy.
- I verified that the user had limited security auditing access as expected.
## SCREENSHOTS
- Identity center instance created.

- Permission set created.

- User created and assigned permission set.

- Confirmation to test whether the user I created can create any resources using Ec2 instance for the test .And it failed to create an instance confirming that the assigned permission set is active as I gave Read Only Access to the user but not to create .

## LESSONS LEARNED
- I learnt how to activate and configure AWS Identity Center.
- I understood the importance of managing user access securely in cloud environments.
- I gained practical experience with permission sets and job function policies in AWS.
- I saw how predefined policies like SecurityAudit help enforce the principle of least privilege.
